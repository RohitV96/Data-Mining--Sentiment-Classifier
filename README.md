Using the given dataset, I created a sentiment classifier in Python that can automatically classify the sentiment of a given movie review as ‘positive’ or ‘negative’. Two classification algorithms, the Support Vector Classifier and the Naive Bayes Classifier, were used for the given task, and the best-performing model was selected for deployment and transformation of raw textual data into a structured format,specifically a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) matrix.The models' accuracy on different subsets of data is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
